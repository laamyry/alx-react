MongoDB A NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. +info +info Architecture The application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected components: Model: Represents the data and the rules that govern access to and updates of this data. In this application, models are defined in the models directory and include BaseModel, User, Favorite, and Course. These models interact with the MongoDB database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. View: Responsible for rendering the application&#39;s user interface. In this application, views are defined in the routes directory and include users, courses, notes, favorites, and categories. These views handle HTTP requests and responses. Controller: Acts as an interface between the Model and the View. It processes all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulates data using the Model component and interacts with the Views to render the final output.

In this application, models are defined in the models directory and include BaseModel, User, Favorite, and Course. These models interact with the MongoDB database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.</p><p>View: Responsible for rendering the application's user interface. In this application, views are defined in the routes directory and include users, courses, notes, favorites, and categories. These views handle HTTP requests and responses.</p><p>Controller: Acts as an interface between the Model and the View. It processes all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulates data using the Model component and interacts with the Views to render the final output.</p><p>Technology used in Front-end</p><h4>Python</h4><p>The front-end of our application is built using ReactJS.
